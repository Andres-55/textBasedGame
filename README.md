# Text-Based Game
I made a text-based game where the objective is to defeat as many enemies as you can until you die. I started off with the idea of just making a turn-based game and while working on it I added more to it. I initially added a way to attack and heal. Then I added spells to the game and special attacks for the enemies. It seemed too repetitive so I added luck to it. So, there is a chance to encounter stronger enemies and also a chance for those enemies to use a stronger attack. This project gave me a better idea of how to use abstraction in an interesting way like a game.
